    "Referring to groups by name, rather than by number, in a regular expression provides several benefits:\n",

    "1. Improved Readability: Using named groups makes the regular expression more readable and self-explanatory. By assigning meaningful names to groups, the intention and purpose of each captured group are clearly conveyed. This enhances code maintainability and makes it easier for others to understand the regex pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Self-Documenting Code: Named groups serve as documentation within the regular expression itself. The names provide descriptive labels for the captured groups, making it easier to understand the significance of each group without needing to refer to external documentation or comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Flexibility: When using named groups, the order of the captured groups becomes less important. You can rearrange the groups or add new groups without needing to update the referencing code that relies on group numbers. This flexibility improves code robustness and reduces the chance of introducing bugs during regex modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code Clarity: When referencing groups by name, the code becomes clearer and less error-prone. Group numbers can be confusing, especially when dealing with complex regex patterns or patterns that require frequent updates. Using names eliminates the need to remember and manage group numbers, leading to more reliable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Specific Group Extraction: Named groups allow you to extract specific groups of interest easily. By referencing groups by name, you can directly access the captured content using the group names instead of relying on positional indices. This simplifies the code for retrieving and utilizing specific captured values.\n",

    "    age = match.group(\"age\")\n",
    "    print(name, age)  # Output: John 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the regular expression pattern `r\"(?P<name>\\w+), (?P<age>\\d+)\"` uses named groups (`name` and `age`) to capture a name and age from the text. By referencing the groups by their names (`match.group(\"name\")` and `match.group(\"age\")`), we can easily access and work with the specific captured values.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this example, the pattern `r\"\\b(?P<word>\\w+)\\b.*\\b(?P=word)\\b\"` is used to find repeated words in the target string. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
