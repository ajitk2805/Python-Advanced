    "In Python, a method is a function defined within a class. It is a special type of function that is associated with a specific class and can be called on instances of that class. Methods define the behavior and actions that objects created from the class can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between methods and regular functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bound to an Object: Methods are bound to a specific object or instance of a class. When a method is called on an instance, it automatically receives the instance itself as the first argument, conventionally named `self`. This allows the method to access and manipulate the instance's data and perform operations specific to that instance. Regular functions, on the other hand, are not bound to any specific object and do not have access to instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access to Instance Variables: Methods have access to the instance variables, also known as instance attributes or instance state, of the object on which they are called. They can read, modify, or update the instance variables, enabling them to operate on the specific state of the object. Regular functions, unless passed the necessary data as arguments, do not have access to instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Defined within a Class: Methods are defined within a class, either as instance methods or class methods. They are part of the class definition and are associated with the class itself. Regular functions, on the other hand, are defined independently of any class and can be used in any context without being tied to a specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implicit First Argument: As mentioned earlier, methods have an implicit first argument conventionally named `self`, which represents the instance on which the method is called. This allows methods to access the instance and its data. Regular functions do not have this implicit first argument and need all their arguments explicitly passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between a method and a regular function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        # Method definition\n",
    "        # Access instance variables using self\n",

    "my_obj.method()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the regular function\n",
    "regular_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `method()` is a method defined within the class `MyClass`. It can access and operate on the instance variables using the `self` argument. On the other hand, `regular_function()` is a regular function that is not tied to any class and does not have access to instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a method is a special type of function defined within a class that is bound to specific instances.

    "Yes, inheritance is supported in Python. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes. In Python, the syntax for inheritance is as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "class ParentClass:\n",

    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",

    "\n",
    "- `ParentClass` is the name of the parent class from which the child class `ChildClass` will inherit.\n",
    "- The child class is defined by specifying the parent class name in parentheses after the child class name.\n",
    "- The child class can inherit attributes (variables) and methods (functions) from the parent class.\n",
    "- The child class can also define its own attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a child class inherits from a parent class, it gains access to all the attributes and methods of the parent class. This means that instances of the child class can use both the inherited attributes and methods as well as the ones defined specifically for the child class.\n",

    "print(car.color)  # Output: Red\n",
    "car.honk()  # Output: Tesla is honking.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Vehicle` is the parent class, and `Car` is the child class that inherits from `Vehicle`. The `Car` class inherits the `name` attribute and the `drive()` method from the `Vehicle` class. It also defines its own attribute `color` and method `honk()`. Instances of the `Car` class can access both the inherited attributes and methods from `Vehicle` and the child class-specific attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, inheritance is supported in Python, and it allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes. The child class syntax involves specifying the parent class name in parentheses after the child class name. The child class can then access and utilize the inherited attributes and methods while also defining its own attributes and methods."

    "Python provides the following naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of variables and methods:\n",

    "1. Public: By default, all variables and methods are considered public, and their names are not prefixed or suffixed with any special characters. Public variables and methods can be accessed and modified from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Protected: Variables and methods intended for internal use within a class or its subclasses are denoted by a single leading underscore (`_`) in their names. It is a convention to indicate that these elements should be treated as internal, although they can still be accessed and modified from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Private: Variables and methods intended to be strictly internal to a class are denoted by a double leading underscore (`__`) in their names. This convention indicates that these elements are private and should not be accessed or modified directly from outside the class. However, Python performs name mangling on private variables and methods, prefixing the class name to make them harder to access, but they are still technically accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that these naming conventions are just conventions and are not enforced by the Python language itself. Python trusts programmers to follow these conventions to indicate the intended visibility and access level.

    "A reflection method, also known as an introspection method, allows an object to examine or modify its own structure, properties, or behavior dynamically at runtime. It provides the ability to retrieve information about the object itself or manipulate its attributes and methods programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to use a reflection method in situations where you need to perform dynamic operations on an object, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Runtime Type Checking: You may need to determine the type of an object dynamically or check if an object belongs to a specific class or has certain attributes or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Attribute Access: Reflection methods can be used to access and modify attributes of an object dynamically. This can be useful when the attributes are not known beforehand or when you want to dynamically interact with an object's properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamic Method Invocation: Reflection methods allow you to invoke methods of an object dynamically based on their names. This can be helpful when the specific method to be called is determined dynamically during runtime.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Performance Considerations: Reflection methods can introduce overhead and impact performance due to the dynamic nature of the operations. If performance is a critical concern and you have a static context, it may be more efficient to directly access the object's attributes and methods without using reflection.\n",
